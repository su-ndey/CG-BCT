Algorithm for Bresenham's Line Drawing

Input:
Read the coordinates of the starting point (x1, y1) and the ending point (x2, y2).
Calculate Differences:
Compute the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates:
delx = |x2 - x1|
dely = |y2 - y1|
Determine Slope:
Calculate the slope m:
If delx is not zero, m = dely / delx
If delx is zero, set m to infinity (vertical line).
Initialize Variables:
Set x and y to the starting coordinates (x1, y1).
Create two empty lists: xcord and ycord to store the coordinates of the points on the line.
Calculate the initial decision parameter P:
If m <= 1, set P = 2 * dely - delx
If m > 1, set P = 2 * delx - dely
Bresenham's Algorithm:
Case 1: If the slope is less than or equal to 1 (i.e., m <= 1):
Loop while x <= x2:
1. Append the current (x, y) to xcord and ycord.
2. If P < 0:
   - Update P by adding 2 * dely.
   - Else:
     - Update P by adding 2 * (dely - delx) and increment y by 1.
3. Increment x by 1.
Case 2: If the slope is greater than 1 (i.e., m > 1):
1. Update P to 2 * delx - dely.
2. Loop while y <= y2:
   - Append the current (x, y) to xcord and ycord.
   - If P < 0:
     - Update P by adding 2 * delx.
   - Else:
     - Update P by adding 2 * (delx - dely) and increment x by 1.
   - Increment y by 1.
Output:
Return the lists xcord and ycord containing the coordinates of the points that form the line.
Plotting:
Use matplotlib to plot the points stored in xcord and ycord.
Set up the plot with labels, title, and grid, and display the plot.
