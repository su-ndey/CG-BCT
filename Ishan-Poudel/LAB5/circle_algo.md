1.Import Libraries:
Import numpy as np.
Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

2.Define circle Function:
Initialize x to 0 and y to r.
Initialize decision parameter p to 1 - r.
Create empty lists xes and yes to store x and y coordinates.
Define a nested function plot to calculate and store the symmetric points of the circle.
Call plot with initial values of x, y, xc, and yc.
Use a while loop to iterate while x is less than y:
Increment x by 1.
Update decision parameter p and y based on the value of p.
Call plot with updated values of x, y, xc, and yc.
Return xes and yes.

3.Define apply_2d_transformation Function:
Stack xes, yes, and an array of ones vertically to form a matrix points.
Apply the transformation matrix to points.
Return the transformed x and y coordinates.

4.Define plot_line_with_transformations Function:
Call circle function to get xes and yes.
Define scaling, translation, and inverse translation matrices.
Compute the composite transformation matrix by multiplying the matrices in the correct order.
Apply the composite transformation matrix to xes and yes using apply_2d_transformation.
Plot the original and transformed points using matplotlib.pyplot.

5.Call plot_line_with_transformations Function:
Call plot_line_with_transformations with radius 50 and center (2, 3).
