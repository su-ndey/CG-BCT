1.Compute Δx and Δy, determine step directions (sx, sy).
2.Use Bresenham's algorithm to generate the line points (xes, yes).
3.Form a rotation matrix for angle θ.
4.Create translation matrices to move line center to origin, apply rotation, then move back.
5.Apply the composite transformation matrix to (xes, yes).
6.Plot both the original line and the transformed line.
