1. Start by importing the `matplotlib.pyplot` library for visualization.  
2. Define a function `midpoint_ellipse` that takes the semi-major axis (`rx`), semi-minor axis (`ry`), and center coordinates (`xc`, `yc`) of the ellipse as inputs.  
3. Initialize the starting point of the ellipse with `x = 0` and `y = ry`.  
4. Create an empty list `points` to store the calculated points on the ellipse.  
5. Define a helper function `plot_symmetry` to calculate and store the symmetric points of the ellipse based on the current `x` and `y` values.  
6. Compute the initial decision parameter `P1` for region 1 of the ellipse using the midpoint ellipse formula.  
7. Compute the initial `dx` and `dy` values, which represent the change in the x and y coordinates, respectively.  
8. Add the symmetric points of the initial position to the list `points` by calling `plot_symmetry`.  
9. Begin iterating in region 1, where the slope of the ellipse is less than 1 (`dx < dy`).  
10. Update the decision parameter `P1` based on its value and adjust `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` accordingly.  
11. Add the newly calculated symmetric points to the list `points` for each iteration in region 1.  
12. Transition to region 2 when `dx` becomes greater than or equal to `dy`.  
13. Compute the initial decision parameter `P2` for region 2 using the midpoint ellipse formula.  
14. Continue iterating in region 2, where the slope of the ellipse is greater than or equal to 1 (`y > 0`).  
15. Update the decision parameter `P2` based on its value and adjust `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` accordingly.  
16. Add the symmetric points to the list `points` for each iteration in region 2.  
17. Return the complete list of points representing the ellipse.  
18. Define the input parameters `xc`, `yc`, `rx`, and `ry` for the ellipse.  
19. Call the `midpoint_ellipse` function to generate the points of the ellipse and store them in `ellipse_points`.  
20. Separate the x and y coordinates of the points using `zip` for plotting.  
21. Create a figure using `matplotlib` and plot the points with `plt.scatter`.  
22. Add labels, title, and grid to the plot for better visualization.  
23. Set the aspect ratio of the plot to "equal" for proper scaling of the ellipse.  
24. Display the plot using `plt.show()`.
