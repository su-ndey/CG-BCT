    "# DDA Line Drawing Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)** algorithm is an incremental method used for line drawing on a grid. It is based on the idea of calculating intermediate points between the starting and ending points of the line and drawing them. This method uses floating-point arithmetic and works well for lines with any slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for DDA Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Coordinates:**\n",
    "   - The user provides two points in the 2D plane:\n",
    "     - Starting Point: `(x1, y1)`\n",
    "     - Ending Point: `(x2, y2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Differences:**\n",
    "   - Calculate the differences in the x and y directions:\n",
    "     - `dx = |x2 - x1|`\n",
    "     - `dy = |y2 - y1|`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine the Number of Steps:**\n",
    "   - The number of steps needed to plot the line is determined by the greater of the differences:\n",
    "     - `steps = max(dx, dy)`\n",
    "   - This ensures that each point is calculated and plotted incrementally along the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Increments:**\n",
    "   - The increments for the x and y coordinates are calculated by dividing the differences by the number of steps:\n",
    "     - `x_incr = dx / steps`\n",
    "     - `y_incr = dy / steps`\n",
    "   - These increments determine how much the x and y values change at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generate Points:**\n",
    "   - Start at the initial point `(x1, y1)`.\n",
    "   - For each step, add the corresponding increments to the current x and y values:\n",
    "     - `x += x_incr`\n",
    "     - `y += y_incr`\n",
    "   - Round the calculated values to the nearest integer to plot discrete points on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Store the Points:**\n",
    "   - Add the calculated points to the lists `x_list` and `y_list` for later plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Output the Points:**\n",
    "   - Print the lists of x and y coordinates of the points on the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Plot the Line:**\n",
    "   - Plot the points stored in `x_list` and `y_list` to visualize the line.\n",
    "   - Highlight the starting and ending points with red markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - The line is drawn between the start and end points, with the grid enabled for better visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome:\n",
    "- The algorithm outputs the points that represent the line and visually displays it on a 2D plot.\n"
