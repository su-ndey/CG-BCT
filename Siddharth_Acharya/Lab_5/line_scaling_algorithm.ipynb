    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Determine Step Directions\n",
    "- Set `sx` and `sy` based on whether `x2 > x1` and `y2 > y1`, to determine the direction for each axis.\n",

    "- If the line has a shallow slope (|m| â‰¤ 1), iterate along the x-axis and adjust the y-coordinate based on the decision parameter.\n",

    "- Collect the `(x, y)` points during each iteration.\n",
