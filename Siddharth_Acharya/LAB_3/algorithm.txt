Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm

Step 1: 
    Import matplot lib for plotting


Step 2:
    Take inputs for centre points and radius [x,y,r]


Step 3:
    Initialize list for circle points


Step 4:
    Initialize the variables
    x=0 : Initial coordinate of x
    y=r : Initial coordinate of y
    p=1-r : Initial parameter


Step 5:
    Define function to add symmetric points : 
    # For xes
        xc + x  # 1st point
        xc - x  # 2nd point
        xc + y  # 3rd point
        xc - y  # 4th point
        xc + x  # 5th point (repeated for symmetry)
        xc - x  # 6th point (repeated for symmetry)
        xc + y  # 7th point (repeated for symmetry)
        xc - y  # 8th point (repeated for symmetry)

    # For yes
        yc + y  # 1st point
        yc + y  # 2nd point (repeated for symmetry)
        yc + x  # 3rd point
        yc + x  # 4th point (repeated for symmetry)
        yc - y  # 5th point
        yc - y  # 6th point (repeated for symmetry)
        yc - x  # 7th point
        yc - x  # 8th point (repeated for symmetry)


Step 6:
    Apply the algorithm
        while x < y:
            x += 1
            if p < 0:
                p += 2 * x + 1
            else:
                y -= 1
                p += 2 * x - 2 * y + 1
            add_circle_points(xc, yc, x, y)

Step 7:   
    Plot the circle points in the list
